# PROJECT TITLE : "IoT Based Global Industrial Process Monitoring through Raspberry Pi"

Tools and Technologies Used: Raspberry Pi 3, Sensors, App Inventor, Python script.

Brief Description: This project aimed to monitor and control the Industrial process through sensors and it
also has a power management and a vehicle parking management all in a single system. The data is
accessible through the website and mobile app.

ABSTRACT:
Internet of Things represents a general concept for the ability of network devices to sense
and collect data from the world around us, and then share that data across the Internet
where it can be processed and utilized for various interesting purposes.
Global industrial process monitoring through IoT is a system that uses a computer or
mobile devices to monitor functions in modern industries. It is intended to spare electric
force and human vitality. The sensors used in this project are temperature, motion
detection through PIR, Vehicle parking management through IR sensors and Gas leakage
detection. These sensors are interfaced with Raspberry Pi and observed values are sent
and stored in cloud.

All the sensors that are connected to the Raspberry Pi are sensing the values at different
conditions and the values are displayed in LCD, simultaneously the values are stored in
the cloud. Whenever there is a change in the measured parameter, the changed values are
updated. This ensures the correctness of the system at every instant of time the values are
automatically updated in the cloud. This project also includes real-time vehicle parking
management i.e. It can find empty spot to park the car thus saving time which can be
done using IR sensor. It also helps in conserving the energy as it automatically turns the
light ON and OFF by detecting the human motion using the PIR sensor.

A Python script is developed for the operation of Raspberry Pi and the sensors interfaced
to it. The data from the sensors is processed by the Raspberry Pi, which is accessible on
the cloud website as well as a mobile application.
